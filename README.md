ProTalk
=======

Welcome to [ProTalk](http://protalk.me), a brand new and exciting open source project.

Mission
-------

We are an online community-driven resource providing a central point of access to audio/ video content with a PHP focus.  

We have big plans for the site which include expanding into other programming languages in the future.  In the meantime, we're covering all aspects of PHP and associated tools.

We soft-launched at DPC12, so we're box-fresh and still in beta - new features and content are being added all the time.

Contributors
------------

Want to help?  Thanks to [JayTaph](https://github.com/jaytaph/) we have a cutting-edge Vagrant/ Puppet setup which makes setting up a stable, reliable ProTalk development environment an absolute doddle.  

We're in the process of migrating the codebase so we'll be up and running here soon.  Watch this space!
